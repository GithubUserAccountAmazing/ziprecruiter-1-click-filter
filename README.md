#### <p align="center">Because sometimes you just don't want to visit 100's of external sites to apply for jobs.</p>

<br>

This script is a simple and convenient way to filter out jobs on ZipRecruiter that do not have a 1-click apply option or a high qualification grade. It works by creating a button on the search results page that allows you to hide jobs based on these criteria. This way, you can focus on the most relevant and easy-to-apply jobs for your search query.

## How to use it

- To use this script, you need to install a browser extension that allows you to run custom JavaScript code on any website. Some examples are Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, or Violentmonkey.
- Once you have installed the extension, create a new script and paste the code from this repository into it. Save the script and enable it.
- Now, whenever you visit a ZipRecruiter search results page (with a URL like https://www.ziprecruiter.com/jobs-search?search=[USER SEARCH QUERY]), you will see a new button on the page that says "Filter Jobs".
- Enjoy applying for jobs faster and easier!
