This script helps you find the best jobs on ZipRecruiter that match your qualifications and preferences. It filters out jobs that require you to visit external sites or have a low qualification grade. It adds a button on the search results page that lets you hide jobs based on these criteria. This way, you can save time and apply for jobs with one click.

## How to use it

- To use this script, you need to install a browser extension that allows you to run custom JavaScript code on any website. Some examples are Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, or Violentmonkey.
- After installing the extension, create a new script and copy the code from this repository into it. Save and activate the script.
- Now, when you go to a ZipRecruiter search results page, you will see a new button that says "Filter Jobs".
- Enjoy applying for jobs faster and easier!
