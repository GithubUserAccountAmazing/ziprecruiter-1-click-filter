A JavaScript program that filters out jobs that require external websites or have low qualification grades. It adds a button on the search results page that lets you hide these jobs and focus on the most relevant and convenient opportunities for your career goals.

## How to use it

- To use this script, you need to install a browser extension that allows you to run custom JavaScript code on any website. Some examples are Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, or Violentmonkey.
- After installing the extension, create a new script and copy the code from this repository into it. Save and activate the script.
- Now, when you go to a ZipRecruiter job search results page, you will see a new button that says "1-Click Filter".
- Enjoy applying for jobs faster and easier!


You can further customize your job search by modifying the `excludeJobTitle` variable by adding keywords that you want to filter out based on your job title preferences. For example, if you don't want to see sales jobs when searching, you can do the following:

```js
let excludeJobTitle = ["Sales", "Sale", "Telesale", "Telesales"];
```
