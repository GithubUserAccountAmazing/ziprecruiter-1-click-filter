## How to use it

- To use this script, you need to install a browser extension that allows you to run custom JavaScript code on any website. Some examples are Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, or Violentmonkey.
- After installing the extension, create a new script and copy the code from this repository into it. Save and activate the script.
- Now, when you go to a ZipRecruiter job search results page, you will see a new button that says "1-Click Filter".
- Enjoy applying for jobs faster and easier!


You can further customize your job search by utilizing the InputBox by adding keywords that you want to filter out based on your job title preferences. For example, if you are looking for a developer job and you don't want to see sales or telesales jobs, you can type those words in the InputBox and they will be excluded from your search after you click enter!
