#### <p align="center">An efficient tool to optimize your job search on ZipRecruiter by only displaying 1-Click Apply jobs. </p>


This is a JavaScript program that eliminates jobs that redirect you to external websites. It adds a button on the search results page that enables you to conceal these jobs and concentrate on the most suitable and convenient opportunities for your career objectives.

## How to use it

- To use this script, you need to install a browser extension that allows you to run custom JavaScript code on any website. Some examples are Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, or Violentmonkey.
- After installing the extension, create a new script and copy the code from this repository into it. Save and activate the script.
- Now, when you go to a ZipRecruiter job search results page, you will see a new button that says "1-Click Filter".
- Enjoy applying for jobs faster and easier!


You can further customize your job search by utilizing the InputBox by adding keywords that you want to filter out based on your job title preferences. For example, if you are looking for a developer job and you don't want to see sales or telesales jobs, you can type those words in the InputBox and they will be excluded from your search after you click enter!

## Known Issues/Limitations

- Some jobs that appear to be '1-Click Apply' may require you to answer additional questions before your application is submitted. This script does not exclude these jobs from the results. 
  - To avoid jobs that ask questions, you could use ublock to block the following element: `www.ziprecruiter.com##.ScreenModalOverlay`
- Some employers may send you an email after you have clicked '1-Click Apply' asking you to visit an external website to 'complete your application'. This script is unable to identify these employers in advance.
